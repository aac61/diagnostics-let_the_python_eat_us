## Update local copy with changes to group project
git fetch upstream # get changes from upstream (the group project)
git brach -va # check what branch you are on
git checkout main # go to main
git merge upstream/main #merge the upstream to main
git branch -va # check local main matchs upstream (if it doesn't run git fetch again)

## Push changes to (personal) fork
git push origin < branch name > --set-upstream
